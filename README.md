Each run contains:

- `cfg.yml` file containing settings used for the run
- some inference examples of the trained model (images beginning with `inference_`)
- `evaluation_result_*` for different test datasets
- `metrics.json`: training log
-  NOTE: `.pth` are not shared

Test datasets used are in `datasets/coco`, along to the scripts used to obtain them.
